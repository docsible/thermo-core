# defaults file for thermo-core

# title: Minimum temperature required for energy generation (in °K)
# required: True
# description: The minimum core temperature required to initiate the energy synthesis process.
min_temperature_threshold: 3000

# title: Target pressure for optimal energy generation (in Pa)
# required: True
# description: Optimal pressure setting for ThermoCore to maximize energy output under safe conditions.
optimal_pressure_threshold: 4500

# title: Maximum cooldown rate allowable (°C/min)
# required: True
# description: The rate at which ThermoCore can cool down without causing structural strain.
max_cooldown_rate: 50

# title: Default coolant level threshold (percentage)
# required: True
# description-lines:
# This variable sets the minimum allowable coolant level for ThermoCore to function.
# If coolant levels fall below this threshold, ThermoCore will initiate emergency coolant refill protocols.
# This prevents overheating and maintains safe operational conditions.
coolant_level_threshold: 30

# title: Safety margin for containment pressure (in Pa)
# required: True
# description: Buffer pressure level in containment to maintain system stability in fluctuating environments.
pressure_safety_margin: 200

# title: Optimal energy storage capacity (in MW)
# required: False
# description: Maximum energy storage capacity of ThermoCore in megawatts. Exceeding this may result in overflow.
max_energy_storage: 500

# title: External temperature check frequency (in seconds)
# required: False
# description: Frequency at which external temperature is checked to adjust ThermoCore energy generation.
external_temp_check_interval: 60

# title: Maximum energy output for safe operation (in MW)
# required: True
# description: Sets the cap for energy output to avoid overloading ThermoCore or connected storage systems.
max_energy_output: 450

# title: High-energy simulation duration (in seconds)
# required: False
# description-lines:
# Specifies the duration ThermoCore operates under high-energy conditions.
# Shorter durations are safer but generate less energy.
# Longer durations may increase energy generation but risk overheating.
simulation_duration: 300
